# Pedal-Project

This repo was created in order for me to easily share the digital files associated with my pedal design side project.

Currently there is not much here besides a high level overview and bill of materials, as much of my work is still confined to hardware prototyping on breadboards.

I am basing the compressor design on the Erica Synths open source compressor design (https://www.ericasynths.lv/media/COMPRESSOR_MANUAL.pdf), although I am modifying it to work in stereo and will change the sidechain detection circuit to allow it to be integrated with the drive circuit in the pedal.
